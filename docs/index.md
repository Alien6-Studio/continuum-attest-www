# Welcome to Continuum Attest

**Verifiable CI/CD Platform with Cryptographic Attestation**

ATTEST is the only CI/CD platform that provides end-to-end cryptographic attestation, from source code to production deployment. Every build step is signed, every artifact is verified, and every deployment is provable.

## Quick Navigation

- **New to ATTEST?** Start with [Overview](overview.md) then [Installation](installation.md)
- **Ready to build?** Jump to [First Steps](first-steps.md)  
- **Core concepts?** Read [Core Concepts](concepts.md)
- **Having issues?** Visit [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

## What You'll Learn

This user guide will teach you how to:

- **Install and configure** ATTEST on any system
- **Create secure pipelines** with cryptographic attestation
- **Implement GitOps** workflows with Kubernetes
- **Enforce policies** and maintain compliance
- **Optimize performance** with intelligent caching
- **Migrate existing** CI/CD pipelines to ATTEST
- **Scale enterprise-wide** with governance and monitoring

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started:

```bash
# Install ATTEST
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alien6-Studio/continuum-attest/main/scripts/install.sh | sh

# Create your first pipeline
cd your-project
attest init

# Run with full security
attest run --verify --sign
```

## Key Features
